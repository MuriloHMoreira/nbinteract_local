The nbinteract module is a tool that allows simple publishing of interactive notebooks. This tool allows instructors to author a notebook in python and publish an interactive web page or online textbook. This is a first step towards allowing instructors to create content that promotes active learning without having to learn the intricacies of web development. These current projects are in development and I aim to submit my results for publication next year.

Creating visualizations that can update dynamically with slick animations can be surprisingly difficult. For example, trying to explain a concept like [linear regression](http://setosa.io/ev/ordinary-least-squares-regression/) or [conditional probability](https://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/compound-probability/index.html#third) in an manner can require mastery of javascript and various packages. The goal of nbinteract is to allow educators to **easily** create interactive models with only Python familiarity.

nbinteract provides an easy way to convert jupyter notebooks into html pages while maintaining the interactive output and widgets. In addition, nbinteract has helper methods built on top of ipywidgets that allow users to create complicated visualizations with simple function calls.
