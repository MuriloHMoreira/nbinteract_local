    "## Exporting With `nbinteract`\n",
    "\n",
    "`nbinteract` comes with two options for exporting Jupyter notebooks into\n",
    "standalone HTML pages: running `nbi.publish()` in a\n",
    "notebook cell and using the `nbinteract` command line tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### `nbi.publish()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `nbi.publish()` method can be run inside a Jupyter notebook cell. It has\n",
    "the following signature:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import nbinteract as nbi\n",
    "\n",
    "nbi.publish(spec, nb_name, template='full', save_first=True)\n",
    "'''\n",
    "Converts nb_name to an HTML file. Preserves widget functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs a link to download HTML file after conversion if called in a\n",
    "notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Equivalent to running `nbinteract ${spec} ${nb_name}` on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Args:\n",
    "    spec (str): BinderHub spec for Jupyter image. Must be in the format:\n",
    "        `${username}/${repo}/${branch}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    nb_name (str): Complete name of the notebook file to convert. Can be a\n",

    "\n",
    "    template (str): Template to use for conversion. Valid templates:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - 'full': Outputs a complete standalone HTML page with default\n",
    "          styling. Automatically loads the nbinteract JS library.\n",
    "        - 'partial': Outputs an HTML partial that can be embedded in\n",
    "          another page. Automatically loads the nbinteract JS library.\n",
    "        - 'gitbook': Outputs an HTML partial used to embed in a Gitbook or\n",
    "          other environments where the nbinteract JS library is already\n",
    "          loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "    save_first (bool): If True, saves the currently opened notebook before\n",
    "        converting nb_name. Used to ensure notebook is written to\n",
    "        filesystem before starting conversion. Does nothing if not in a\n",
