    "GitHub Pages is one of the simplest ways to host webpages for others to view.\n",

    "## Creating an Account and Repo\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, visit https://github.com/ and create an account. If you already have\n",
    "an account, you should log in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, create a new repo. You may do this using the GitHub UI or visiting\n",
    "https://github.com/new . Name the repo `nbinteract-tutorial`. If you'd like a\n",
    "different name, feel free to name it something else. However, we will use this\n",
    "repo name in later parts of the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your repo is public, and click the checkbox to initialize your repo\n",

    "Now, click on the Settings link for the repo near the top of the page, scroll\n",
    "down to the GitHub Pages section, and select the `master` branch as the GitHub\n",

    "The easiest way to create this repo is to visit\n",
    "https://github.com/SamLau95/nbinteract-image and click the Fork button in the\n",
