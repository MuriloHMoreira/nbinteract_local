Widgets are a tool taken from the ipywidgets Python module used to visualize changes in data. We will be showing you briefly how to create widgets in order to explain more complicated examples later. A more indepth explanation can be found in the [ipywidgets documentation](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
