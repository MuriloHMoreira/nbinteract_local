<p>In this section, you will create an interactive simulation of the Monty Hall Problem. You may continue writing code in the notebook from the previous section or create a new one for this section.</p></div></div></div>

<h2 id="The-Monty-Hall-Problem">The Monty Hall Problem<a class="anchor-link" href="#The-Monty-Hall-Problem">¶</a></h2><p>The Monty Hall Problem (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem">Wikipedia</a>) is a famous probability problem that has stumped many, mathematicians included. The problem goes something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to switch your choice to door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps unintuitively, you will win the prize about twice as often if you switch doors. We can show this through simulation.</p></div></div></div>
