# Changelog

This file contains the changes made for each version of `nbinteract`. Since
the package contains both a Python and a JavaScript component, we keep the
version numbers for both Python and JS packages the same so updates are easier
to keep track of.

## master

## 0.1.1

**Python**

Bugs fixed:

- Converting using `full.tpl` now correct hides cells with `# HIDDEN`
- Using `nbi.publish` now works on Python versions < 3.5
